module FlatMap
  # This module provides some integration between mapper and its target,
  # which is usually an ActiveRecord model, as well as some integration
  # between mapper and Rails forms.
  #
  # In particular, validation and save methods are defined here. And
  # the <tt>save</tt> method itself is defined as a callback. Also, Rails
  # multiparam attributes extraction is defined within this module.
